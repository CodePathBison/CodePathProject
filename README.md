## Overview
### Description
An app to allow Black parents to find Black babysitters in their area.

### App Evaluation
- **Category:** Business
- **Mobile:** Mobile first experience
- **Story:** Allows users to search for Black babysitters or for babysitting gigs
- **Market:** People with Black children
- **Habit:** Not very habit forming. Users either look for new babysitters or search for gigs. Habits could possibly form while looking for multiple gigs but may subside after repeated bookings.
- **Scope:** The scope is very narrow, just booking/searching.
